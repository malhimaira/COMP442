2. LL(1) grammar

   NOTE: The .grm file is one of the many possible LL(1) grammars that correspond to the transformation of the
         original grammar given in assignment 2. This grammar is provided in case the transofrmed grammar that
	 you used to implement your parser turned out to be wrong. There is no penalty associated with using
	 this grammar to fix the problems with your parser, and you dont have to use it if you are satisfied
	 with your parser.   

   grammar/LL1grammar.grm                                LL1 grammar in the grammartool format
   grammar/bubblesort.AtoCC.tokenstream.txt              kfgEdit-readable/FLACI token stream for the bubblesort example program 
   grammar/polynomial.AtoCC.tokenstream.txt              kfgEdit-readable/FLACI token stream for the polynomial example program
   grammar/expressions-statements.AtoCC.tokenstream.txt  kfgEdit-readable/FLACI token stream for testing idnest cases 
   
3. example outast output

   NOTE: These examples are for a language grammar that is slightly different from the one we have now.
         The exact output needs to be adapted to the language grammar that we have now.
